			Can be cheaper, but are less reliable, and pay extra attention to the luggage options as it's included not in the price and can be expensive.

		<h2>Lithuania Travel Guide 🇱🇹</h2>
		<p>We are so glad to have you coming to Lithuania, country of lakes, nature, witches, pagan traditions and medieval cities. Here are just a few highlights! Lithuania is car paradise, with an exception of the old towns of the main cities.</p>

		<hr />

		<img src="assets/vilnius.png" />
		<h3>Vilnius</h3>
		<p>2-3 days to visit. Berta studied here, so good luck meeting people from there during the party who can show you around the best bars!</p>
		<br/>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Old Town:</strong> Vilnius Old Town, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is packed with beautiful Baroque architecture, narrow cobblestone streets, and charming courtyards. Be sure to visit the <strong>Gates of Dawn</strong> and the <strong>Cathedral Square</strong>.</li>
			<li><strong>Uzupis:</strong> This bohemian neighborhood declared itself a “republic” and has its own constitution, quirky art, and a free-spirited vibe. It's a must-see for art lovers.</li>
			<li><strong>Gediminas' Tower:</strong> For the best views of the city, head to Gediminas' Tower. You'll also learn a bit about Lithuanian history at the museum inside.</li>
		</ul>

		<hr />

		<img src="assets/kaunas.png" />
		<h3>Kaunas</h3>
		<p>1-3 days. Home city of Berta!</p>
		<br/>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Old Town:</strong> Kaunas' Old Town is less crowded than Vilnius, offering a relaxed experience with historical sites like <strong>Kaunas Castle</strong> and the <strong>Town Hall Square</strong>.</li>
			<li><strong>Laisvės Alėja (Liberty Avenue):</strong> This pedestrian street is great for a leisurely walk, with cafes, shops, and beautiful interwar architecture.</li>
			<li><strong>Street Art:</strong> Kaunas has a thriving street art scene, with murals around the city, including the famous <strong>Pink Elephant</strong> mural.</li>
			<li><strong>Spurginė</strong> is a nostalgic doughnut café on Laisvės Alėja, dating back to the 1970s. Famous for its <strong>spurgos</strong> (Lithuanian doughnuts) with fillings like jam or curd, it offers a cozy, time-capsule vibe. Loved by locals, it's a must-visit for an authentic taste of Kaunas history!</li>
			<li><strong>Tadas Invanauskas Zoological Museum:</strong> In case of bad weather, Kaspers favorite museum houses a huge collection of stuffed animals in various impressive displays.</li>
		</ul>

		<hr />

		<h3>Seaside</h3>
		<p>Lithuania's coast offers sandy beaches, scenic dunes, and charming coastal towns. <strong>Palanga</strong> is a lively resort town with a bustling boardwalk, while <strong>Klaipėda</strong> has a historic old town with German architecture. <strong>The Curonian Spit</strong>, a UNESCO site, is a stunning natural area with endless dunes and pine forests, ideal for hiking, biking, and wildlife spotting. Berta's childhood summers were also spent there: Palanga is called a town of grandmas, and Berta's grandmother also lived there!</p>

		<hr />

		<img src="assets/trakai.png" />
		<h3>Trakai</h3>
		<p>Just outside Vilnius, <strong>Trakai</strong> is famous for its picturesque <strong>island castle</strong> on Lake Galvė. Surrounded by lakes, it's perfect for boat rides and scenic views. The town also has Karaim heritage, and visitors can try traditional Karaim pastries called kibinai. Yes, the wedding venue is very close to this and yes, you will be able to try kibinai during the wedding. </p>

		<hr />

		<img src="assets/jonines.png" />
		<h3>Joninės</h3>
		<p><strong>Joninės (Midsummer Festival)</strong> is celebrated on June 23-24 and marks the summer solstice, so it's a perfect festivity to experience if you hop on a plane a few days earlier. It's one of Lithuania's most beloved traditions, featuring bonfires, music, dancing, and nature rituals. People gather to celebrate outdoors, often by lakes or in parks, making flower wreaths, jumping over fires for good luck, and welcoming the longest day of the year.</p>
		<br/>
		<p><strong>Top Places to Celebrate Joninės:</strong></p>
		<br/>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Kernavė:</strong> Historic and traditional festivities.</li>
			<li><strong>Vilnius (Vingis Park):</strong> Central, lively, and family-friendly.</li>
			<li><strong>Kaunas Castle Grounds:</strong> Festive with a historical backdrop.</li>
			<li><strong>Rumšiškės Open-Air Museum:</strong> Authentic folk atmosphere.</li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		<p>Wherever you go, Joninės offers a warm, festive atmosphere with a mix of tradition and Lithuanian folklore!</p>
