		<h2>Program</h2>
		<p>
			On Saturday will be the wedding ceremony, dinner and party.<br/><br/>
			We will be doing this wedding the Lithuanian way, which means everybody will be able to stay over at the venue on us - so you can party as long as you want!<br/><br/>
			We're trying our best to make the most comfortable lodging for everyone, but please be prepared to share a room and/or bathroom.<br/><br/>
			The second day there will be breakfast (mimosas!) and lunch (šašlykai!) for those who want to stay and relax in the nature, and enjoy the natural pool or a hottub - so don't forget your swimsuits.<br/><br/>
		</p>
		<h3>👙 Afterparty</h3>
		<p>
			For those who want to continue the party, there will be additional relaxing and time for potential activities in the days after the wedding.<br/><br/>
			First of all, for those who would like to stay a second night with us at the venue (from Sunday to Monday), this is possible at your own cost of €20 per person. Please let us know in the RSVP and we will make sure there's a spot for you.<br/><br/>
			Secondly, we will be staying for a few days in BLABLA CAMPSITE to be more deeply in Lithuanian nature and would also love it for you to join us. If you want to join us here, please make a booking yourself, we will be there from Monday to Wednesday.<br/><br/>
			Whether you'll be staying with us the extra days or not, the venue is located in the Trakai District which is close to many interesting places to visit. Please refer to our travel guide for inspiration.

		<h2 id="howtogetthere">How to get to this strange country?</h2>
		<p>
			If you're too lazy to drive for 17 hours, don't worry - airplanes exist!<br/><br/>
			Both Vilnius and Kaunas are good options to fly to. But from the Netherlands there are two main options:<br/><br/>
			<strong>AirBaltic (Amsterdam -> Vilnius)</strong><br/>
			Comfortable, slightly more expensive.<br/><br/>
			<strong>WizzAir (Eindhoven -> Vilnius)</strong><br/>
			Can be cheaper, but is less reliable, and pay extra attention to the luggage options as it's included not in the price and can be expensive.
